# Brain-Density-Virtual-Hand-Model

# Overview
This project aims to, 1. Collect sEMG signals with the Quattrocento amplification and filtering device 2. Record camera footage of hand motion from multiple angle to be processed into a 3D reconstruction of a virtual hand 3. Map the sEMG signals to the 3D hand motion data with a Neural Network
